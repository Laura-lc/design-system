    <p class="ds-text">The U.S. federal government seeks to act in the best interests of its citizens through this
      system of checks and balances.</p>


    <ul class="ds-c-list">
      <li><a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> – There are two elected Senators per state, totaling 100 Senators.
        A Senate term is six years and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives </a>– There are 435 elected Representatives, which
        are divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. There are additional non-voting
        delegates who represent the District of Columbia and the territories. A Representative serves a two-year term,
        and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="ds-h2">Executive Branch</h2>
    <p class="ds-text">The <a href="https://bensguide.gpo.gov/a-executive">executive branch</a> carries out and enforces
      laws. It includes the President, Vice President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and
      other boards, commissions, and committees.</p>
    <p class="ds-text">American citizens have the right to vote for the President and Vice President through free,
      confidential ballots.</p>
    <p class="ds-text">Key roles of the executive branch include:</p>
    <ul class="ds-c-list">
      <li>President – The President leads the country. He/she is the head of state, leader of the federal government,
        and Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces. The President serves a four-year term and can be
        elected no more than two times.</li>
      <li>Vice President – The Vice President supports the President. If the President is unable to serve, the Vice
        President becomes President. The Vice President can be elected and serve an unlimited number of four-year terms
        as Vice President, even under a different president.</li>
      <li>The Cabinet – Cabinet members serve as advisors to the President. They include the Vice President and the
        heads of executive departments. Cabinet members are nominated by the President and must be approved by the
        Senate (with at least 51 votes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ds-h2">Judicial Branch</h2>

    <p class="ds-text">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/judicial-branch">judicial branch</a> interprets the
      meaning of laws, applies laws to individual cases, and decides if laws violate the Constitution.</p>



    <ul class="ds-c-list">
      <li><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> – The Supreme Court is the highest court in the
        United States. The Justices of the Supreme Court are nominated by the President and must be approved by the
        Senate.
        <ul class="ds-c-list">
          <li>The court is comprised of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/faq.aspx#faqgi6">nine members</a> — a
            Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices. Currently, there is one Associate Justice vacancy. A minimum or
            quorum of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/faq.aspx#faqgi8">six justices</a> is required to decide a
            case.</li>
          <li>If there is an even number of Justices and a case results in a tie, the lower court's decision stands.
          </li>
          <li>There is no fixed term for Justices. They serve until their death, retirement, or removal in exceptional
            circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts.aspx">Other federal courts</a> – The Constitution grants
        Congress the authority to establish other federal courts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="ds-h3">Judge/Justice Confirmation Process</h3>

    <p class="ds-text">Appointments for Supreme Court justices and other federal judgeships follow the same basic
      process:</p>

    <ul class="ds-c-list">
      <li>The President nominates a person to fill a vacant judgeship.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/nominations">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> holds a hearing on
        the nominee and votes on whether to forward the nomination to the full Senate.</li>
      <li>If the nomination moves forward, the Senate can debate the nomination. Debate must end before the Senate can
        vote on whether to confirm the nominee. A Senator will request unanimous consent to end the debate, but any
        Senator can refuse.</li>
      <li>Without unanimous consent, the Senate must pass a <a
          href="https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Cloture_vrd.htm">cloture</a> motion to end the
        debate. For most federal judgeships, the cloture motion requires a simple majority—51 votes—to pass.</li>
      <li>For Supreme Court nominees, cloture requires a three-fifths majority—60 votes—to pass.</li>
      <li>If the cloture motion doesn’t pass, debate continues in what’s known as a <a
          href="https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Filibuster_vrd.htm">filibuster</a>. The
        filibuster can effectively <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Filibuster">stall the process of voting on
          confirmation indefinitely</a>.</li>
      <li>Once the debate ends and the Senate votes on confirmation, just 51 votes are needed to confirm the nominee for
        Supreme Court justice or any other federal judgeship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="ds-h3">Filibusters and the “Nuclear Option”</h3>

    <p class="ds-text">Prior to November 2013, all federal judgeship nominations required 60 votes to reach cloture and
      end the debate on a nominee.</p>

    <p class="ds-text">
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Federal_Vacancy_Warning_System:_113th_Congress#Notable_news">In 2013, the Senate
        lowered the number of votes required from 60 to 51</a> for federal judgeships excluding the Supreme Court, using
      the <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Obama%27s_federal_nominees,_2013#.22Nuclear_option.22">"nuclear option."</a>
      This interpretation of Senate procedure gives Members the ability to change chamber rules with a simple majority
      vote.
